SkinAlyze:
A CNN-Based Skin Lesion Classifier Using the HAM10000 Dataset:

SkinAlyze is a deep learning-based project that classifies dermoscopic skin images into seven medical diagnostic categories. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the HAM10000 dataset to aid in identifying both benign and malignant skin conditions.

Features:

>> Organized dataset into class-specific folders for streamlined model input
>> Trained a CNN model on over 5,000 skin lesion images
>> Evaluated model performance using training/validation accuracy and loss
>> Generated classification reports and confusion matrices for evaluation
>> Enabled image upload and real-time diagnosis using the trained model
>> Displayed full disease names along with prediction confidence
>> Saved the trained model in .h5 format for reuse and deployment
